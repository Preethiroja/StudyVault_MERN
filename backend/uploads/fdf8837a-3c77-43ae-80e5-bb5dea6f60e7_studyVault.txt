Good morning everyone. My project is StudyVault-AI powered collaborative learning dashboard. It helps students study together in one place. It uses AI to summarize  notes, shows  learning as a visual map, and lets you collaborate with friends on a live whiteboard.
its goal was to make studying easier and faster.  

1. 📝 NOTES
"First is the Notes page. When you type your notes here, AI reads . It creates a summary and a quiz automatically. If you’re confused, you can even ask the AI tutor a question about your notes."

2. 🕸️ GRAPH
"Next is the Graph. This turns your notes into a visual map. It shows you how your different subjects are connected.

3. 🎨 WHITEBOARD
"This is the Whiteboard. It’s a live space where two people can draw together at the same time. It’s great for explaining a math problem or a drawing diagram 

4. 💬 CHAT
"Our Chat has a Public Hall for everyone and Private Rooms for groups. You can create a secret room, share the link, or invite friends and start talking to your study group instantly."
 
5. 📅 CALENDAR
"The Calendar helps you manage your time. You can add your task and deadlines here. The website will even send a notification to your computer to remind you when a task is due."

6. 🏆 LEADERBOARD
"we have a Leaderboard. You earn points for studying and being active. It’s a friendly way to compete with your classmates and stay motivated."

7. 📁 FILES
"Finally, we have the Files section. This is your digital folder. You can upload PDFs, images, and slides so all your study materials are in one safe place and it can also be shared it to your friends."
